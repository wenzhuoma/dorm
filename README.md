I used Java to develop Intelligent Dormitory Allocation System by utilizing the Springboot framework and front-end LayUI components.  The management system is to help teachers assign dormitories and manage students’ basic information.    Students who need to live in dormitories will complete a personality test, and students with the same personality will be assigned together as a result.    The purpose of this arrangement is to reduce conflicts among students and increase teachers’ efficiency on dormitory management.
For daily student management, teachers can learn about the overall situation of students via the statistics tab. For student dormitory arrangement statistics, teachers can view the number of students who have been assigned dormitories by a bar chart of echarts.  For personality test statistics, teachers can view the number of students who have taken the test by a rose chart of echarts.
